Summary: Every month we participate in the [Developer Co-op](http://meetup.com/dev-coop/) meetup in Liberty Lake, Washington. This month we had part 3 of learning neural networks. We talked projects, ate pizza, and had a great time!
Status: draft



We took our neurons where previously we had calculated their values and weights, this week
we added errors and real training!

We finally got an actual neural network trained to output '1' when input '2'! I know that doesn't
sound very cool, but building it from scratch with great friends was super awesome.

Thanks for attending guys, have a great Christmas/New Years!
