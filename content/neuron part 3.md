Summary: This month at the [Developer Co-op](http://meetup.com/dev-coop/) we had part 3 of learning neural networks. We took our neurons where previously we had calculated their values and weights, this week we added errors and real training!

We finally got an actual neural network trained to output '1' when input '2'! I know that doesn't
sound very cool, but building it from scratch with great friends was super awesome.

Thanks for attending guys, have a great Christmas/New Years!
