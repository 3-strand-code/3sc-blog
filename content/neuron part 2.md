Summary: Every month we participate in the [Developer Co-op](http://meetup.com/dev-coop/) meetup in Liberty Lake, Washington. This month we had part 2 of learning neural networks. We talked projects, ate pizza, and had a great time!

### Layers and networks

This week [Levi Thomason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levithomason) went over his next lesson on neural networks. We made layers,
connected them to each other, and then connected them all together in a network.

In preparation for this meet up [Jason Rutherford](https://github.com/jason-rutherford) made an awesome [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/jason-rutherford/neural-network) of his neural network
including tests an award winning readme! :)

Lookin good boys! 


### What's next

We'll enable our networks to be trained to output desired values based on some input.
