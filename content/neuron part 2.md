Every month we participate in the [Developer Co-op](http://meetup.com/dev-coop/) meetup in Liberty Lake, Washington. This month we
had part 2 of learning neural networks. We talked projects, ate pizza, and had a great time!

### Layers and networks

This week (Levi Thomason)[http://levithomason.com] went over his next lesson on neural networks. We made layers,
connected them to each other, and then connected them all together in a network.

Also, in preparation for this meet up [Jason Rutherford](https://github.com/jason-rutherford) made an awesome [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/jason-rutherford/neural-network) of his neural network
including tests an award winning readme! :)

Lookin good boys!

Also, another new project spawned: neural network processing helper called [brains](http://github.com/dev-coop/brains). 

Here's a link to [part 1 in this series](neural-networks-part-1-the-neuron.html)
