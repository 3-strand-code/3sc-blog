Authors: Eric Carmichael
Summary: This is the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks from the ground up. We start with an individual neuron and it's connections!



Last month we did the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks from the ground up. <cont>

What makes a neuron <cont>
How is it similar to the brain <cont>
Connections, weights <cont>
Training: back propagation <cont>

```js
var foo;
```

```python
from var import test

def test():
    asdf

```


test

# Test

 * asfd
 * asdfasd

 ```
 var foo;
 ```

[python tests](https://github.com/dev-coop/neural-net-hacking-examples/blob/master/python/neural_network_with_connections_tests.py)

Stay tuned for part 2 next month! We'll be layering and maybe even training our neurons!
