Summary: This is the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks from the ground up. We start with an individual neuron and it's connections!



Last month we did the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks from the ground up. <cont>

What makes a neuron <cont>
How is it similar to the brain <cont>
Connections, weights <cont>
Training: back propagation <cont>

# Test

 * asfd
 * asdfasd

 ```
 var foo;
 ```


Some examples:
<javascript>
<ruby>
<erl or whatever that was?>
<python>

Stay tuned for part 2 next month! We'll be layering and maybe even training our neurons!
