Authors: Eric Carmichael
Summary: This is the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks from the ground up. We start with an individual neuron and it's connections!



Last month we did the first part of a many part series about creating Neural Networks
from the ground up. I'll briefly cover some of what Levi went over but I won't do it
justice! You'll have to come to the meet-ups to get the full effect.


What makes a neuron <cont>
 - connected through axons
 - fires with threshold

How is it similar to the brain <cont>


First we started by making an individual neuron and






Connections, weights <cont>

Stay tuned for part 2 next month! We'll be layering and maybe even training our neurons!
