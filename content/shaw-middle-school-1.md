![On Track Academy](/images/events/ontrack_academy_2.jpg) We get the opportunity to talk to students in our community every so often, this time we're talking to a group of students
in the [On Track Academy](http://www.spokaneschools.org/ontrack) at [Shaw Middle School](http://www.spokaneschools.org/Domain/1179).

They were a great group of enthusiastic students... in fact, one bright student is already doing animation and experimenting 
with making her own webpages! They asked lots of questions, got excited, and applied for the program. Can't wait to see
where we are a year from now!
