Summary: ![KTec](/images/events/ktec.jpg) A few weeks ago we went to [ktec](http://ktectraining.org/) an awesome technical school in Rathdrum, Idaho. We did a little presentation about our lives (far from perfect), how we got here (successful developers), and what we're doing to help others achieve the same ends ([3 Strand Code!](http://3strandcode.com)).

A few weeks ago we went to [ktec](http://ktectraining.org/), an awesome technical school in Rathdrum, Idaho. We did a
little presentation about our lives (far from perfect), how we got here (successful developers), and what we're doing to help others
achieve the same ends ([3 Strand Code!](http://3strandcode.com)).

We first met ktec's computer hardware instructor, [Jason Green](http://ktectraining.org/jason-green.html) a couple
months ago.  He was very open and excited about what we're offering, high tech job training and placement.
He introduced us to his students and we were blown away by their response.
We're super thankful to be collaborating with Jason and ktec.

We heard comments like: 

>[3 Strand Code] is exactly what I'm looking for... it's like you guys are giving me everything on
a turkey platter!

Last week Jason and I did some [AutoIt](http://autoitscript.com) experiments using the aging classic 
[Age of Empires II](http://www.ageofempires.com/).  

<br><br>

Jason got AutoIt to:

 * Iterate through his barracks to build as many spearmen as possible
 * Send one unit to explore whole map using a waypoint system
 
Meanwhile many students were exploring HTML and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. A few other students were
doing some advanced work with 3d modeling and unity.

Rock on Ktec, we hope to be back soon!
