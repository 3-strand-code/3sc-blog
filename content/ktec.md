Summary: ![KTec](/images/events/ktec.jpg) A few weeks ago we went to [ktec](http://ktectraining.org/) an awesome technical school in Rathdrum, Idaho. We did a little presentation about our lives (far from perfect), how we got here (successful developers), and what we're doing to help others achieve the same ends ([3 Strand Code!](http://3strandcode.com)).

A few weeks ago we went to [ktec](http://ktectraining.org/) an awesome technical school in Rathdrum, Idaho. We did a
little presentation about our lives (far from perfect), how we got here (successful developers), and what we're doing to help others
achieve the same ends ([3 Strand Code!](http://3strandcode.com)).


[Jason Green](http://ktectraining.org/jason-green.html) introduced us to his students and we were blown away by their response.
One student commented, "[3 Strand Code] is exactly what I'm looking for... it's like you guys are giving me everything on
a turkey platter!"

Last week Jason and I did some [AutoIt](http://autoitscript.com) experiments using the aging classic 
[Age of Empires II](http://www.ageofempires.com/).  Jason got autoit to:

 * Iterate through his barracks to build as many spearmen as possible
 * Send one unit to explore whole map using a waypoint system
 
Meanwhile many students were exploring HTML and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. A few other students were
doing some advanced work with 3d modeling and unity.

Rock on Ktec, we hope to be back soon!
